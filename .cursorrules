# Hipoteca AI - AI-First Development Rules

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Read LLMS.md Files First

Before making ANY changes, read these files to understand the codebase context:
- `/src/LLMS.md` - Overall architecture, business context, and change history
- `/src/app/LLMS.md` - Next.js routes, API structure
- `/src/components/LLMS.md` - Component patterns and UI architecture

These files contain pre-computed context to avoid codebase exploration on every task.

## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation is Non-Negotiable
- Update relevant LLMS.md files with every change
- Add change-log entries explaining what changed and why
- Keep file structure descriptions current

### 2. Spanish Mortgage Market Focus
- B2C language only - no technical jargon
- Professional but accessible tone
- Spanish mortgage regulations and standards
- 0-100 risk scoring with clear labels

### 3. UI-First Development
- Design from Spanish consumer perspective
- Follow existing component patterns in `/src/components/`
- Use established shadcn/ui components
- Mobile-first, accessibility-compliant

### 4. AI Integration Standards
- Dual knowledge sources (contract + general mortgage knowledge)
- Mandatory source citation for all AI responses
- Streaming chat interfaces with Vercel AI SDK
- Background processing via Trigger.dev

### 5. Code Quality
- Full TypeScript type safety
- User-scoped data operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization for large PDFs

## Tech Stack Reminders
- Next.js 15 App Router
- Clerk authentication
- Redis (metadata) + Weaviate (vectors)
- Biome for linting/formatting
- UploadThing for file handling

## Before Deployment
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run biome:check`
- Test from consumer perspective
- Verify B2C language consistency
- Update change-logs in LLMS.md files
